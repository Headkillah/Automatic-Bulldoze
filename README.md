# Automatic Bulldoze - Original By [Sadler](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=406132323&searchtext=bulldoze)

This is a continuation of the awesome mode made by Sadler.

As of right now, the only changes made are removal of unused code and adding of a little tooltip indictator to tell how many buildings are being affected
